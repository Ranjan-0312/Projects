      <p>With the classical traditions of music in India like the Hindustani classical tradition and the Carnatic classical tradition, music has been an integral part of the socio-religious expressions of cultural values as dance in India. Music has a place of primacy in Indian culture. In traditional aesthetics music is often allegorised as â€˜the food for the soulâ€™. It has the power to quench human anguish, and it is that form of art, which is easily accessible and has instantaneous effects on oneâ€™s mind. The major vocal forms associated with Hindustani classical music are the Khayal, ghazal, dhrupad, Dadra and thumri. Carnatic music is south Indian classical music and is composed of a system of Ragam( raga) and Thalam (tala). It has a rich history and tradition and is one of the gems of world music. Music has always been an important aspect of the lives of Indian people. Indiaâ€™s rich cultural diversity has contributed to various forms of folk music. India is a whole new world with an array of different kinds of folk music in different corners of the country and a plethora of native instruments.
